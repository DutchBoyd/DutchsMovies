# Dutch's Movies

Finished the official Microsoft ASP.NET tutorial (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-3.1), building a movie database in ASP.NET using RazorPages. Here is the finished app.

Features I'm working on: 

1. Adding movie poster image.
2. Web scraping to build and add to the database.
3. Add users.
4. Use API calls to login the users
